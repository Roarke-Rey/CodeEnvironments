I was the moderator for the meeting of my group. My main motive was to discuss the importance of daily stand up meetings for our company. As a moderator, I made sure that everyone had their say and were able to communicate properly which was well received by everyone. Being in a small group, we were also able to discuss pertaining to the topic and not deviate from our discussion.

I was the secretary in the meeting for my group. My job was to take notes of what was discussed so we can refer back to it late. As the secretary, I made note of what everyone said in a shared folder and took meeting minutes. As our group is small, I was able to take detailed notes without running out of time.
